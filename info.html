I have worked on WebGFA for over a year. In the beginning, it was great! I had many people who went on WebGFA, around 400 monthly users.
Now, in September of seventh grade, that number dropped to 200. Then, it stayed the same until the Winter Break, where the monthly user count 
dropped to only 50. I have decided that it is not worth it to run WebGFA anymore. It costs too much in money and takes too much time to keep the website running.
Thank you for everyone who has used this site.
