    <h2>Major Update</h2>
    <h3>Quick overview</h3>
    <p>WebGFA will get a major update. To get games, you will have to pay for them with GFA coins. To get GFA-Coins, you can watch ads or pay for them with cash. One random game will be free to play each day. If you paid before then, you will receive the amount you paid for in GFA-Coins. You start with 100 GFA coins and can buy games in an auction. The games can be Roblox for 1 hour or Vex 8 for three days.</p>
    <h3>How to get GFA-Coins</h3>
    <p>To get GFA Coins, you can pay in cash, with the conversion rate of 100 GFA Coins at $1.00, or by watching advertisements to get some GFA Coins. The exchange rate of GFA Coins per advertisement will be calculated along the way.</p>
    <h3>How to play games</h3>
    <p>When you first create an account, you will receive 1 hour of gameplay time for all games. Gameplay time is considered when you open and close the game page. For all games, it means that it is combined time, so 30 minutes of Cookie Clicker and 30 mins of Retro Bowl will amount to 1 hour of all games. The auction will be there to get more games, and different games will be available to play by bidding for them. Also, you will get one random game to play each day for free.</p>
    <h3>Storage Updates</h3>
    <p>Another thing that will happen is storage updates. Since we will be converting to Firebase, we can store data online without cookies. So if you lost your save because something happened to it, then you can restore your save from our database. Also, your passwords will be much more secure. Currently, passwords are stored in plain text in the code. We are working to convert all the passwords to a Firebase storage database.</p>
    <h3>Other events</h3>
    <p>At some specific time, random events can happen. For example, if at least 25 people are playing Cookie Clicker during homeroom, you can each receive 15 minutes of Cookie Clicker playing time. These events can happen randomly, and notifications will be available to those who want them.</p>
