    <h3>Quick paragraph</h3>
    <p>WebGFA will get a major update. To get games, you will have to pay for them with GFA-Coins. To get GFA-Coins you can watch ads or pay for them with cash. One random game will be free to play each day. If you paid before then you will recieve the amount you paid for in GFA-Coins. You start with 100 GFA-Coins and will be able to buy games in a auction. The games can be Roblox for 1 hour, or Vex 8 for 3 days.</p>
    <h3>How to get GFA-Coins</h3>
    <p>To get GFA-Coins you can buy them with money, 100 GFA-Coins for 1$, or watching advertisments.</p>
