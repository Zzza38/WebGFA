A games site developed for my school. I own and operate this website independently, hoping for someone to help me. The only link is currently at https://learnis.site
Because I don't want to leak all of the data when my school sysadmins find this, no personal information that can help shut this website down is posted. This also helps you adopt it for yourself a lot easier. Once I get to a good point with this site, where nothing is Firebase based then I will convert it to a game site that is easy to work with.
