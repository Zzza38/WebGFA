    <h2 class="updateLog " id="sectionHeader">Custom about:blank cloaking</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Have you ever been on interstellar? Well, if you haven't then you should know
      that you can customise what the about:blank cloak looks like. Schoology, Google Drive, and more. I am adding this
      feature into WebGFA soon!</p>
    <h2 class="updateLog" id="sectionHeader">Secure chatting</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Ever wanted to talk to your friends during school but you are seperated by a
      wall? Well, WebGFA can fix that! Secure chatting will ensure your chats cannot be read by the school, while still
      being fast! Who knows, maybe even video will be added!</p>
    <h2 class="updateLog" id="sectionHeader">Customized profile</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Want a profile with a bio, picture, and status? Well, we can help you! WebGFA
      will be able to get people profiles! This will roll out with secure chatting.</p>
    <h2 class="updateLog" id="sectionHeader">Looking for people</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Want some quick cash? Well, if you have web development skills, I could use
      some help! After all, this has been a one man job since the beginning. Come see me for details.</p>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">I am also looking for a logo redesign, because if you took the time to look you
      would relize that WebGFA's logo is just a poorly colored version of WebLFG's logo. It's also where the name WebGFA
      came from.</p>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Submitting a design, both handdrawn and digital is just as easy as <a
        href="./submitlogo.html">clicking me</a>. Fill out a form and you might get accepted, and if I like your logo
      the best then you will recieve 10$ as a reward.</p>
