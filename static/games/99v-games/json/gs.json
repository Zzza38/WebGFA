Like the original, players run through different worlds called 'zones', which each have their own specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress. The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called 'Badniks'. This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg. Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world.",

All the levels have the same themes to them they originally had, but with new layouts and enemy placement, I also wanted to keep the classic feel to it, which is why I used mostly graphics from CV2 and 3. There are very few custom graphics in the hack, I’m not good with graphics at all, but I did make a new title screen using the new CV logo (Which Moonchile later enhanced) and enhanced some of the orignal sprits. Any Castlevania fan will probably like this, but until recently I didn’t notice it’s one downside: It’s hard. As I made this hack I pretty much learned how everything in CV’s game engine works, the exact timing of enemies and such. So, while I can play through most of it with no problems even my friends who are good at Castlevania die several times on the first level.

Instead, he led a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned. Eighty years have passed since then. One day, something strange happens to a young boy who lives in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters: his house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge.

Landing on top of your opponents will cause their balloons to pop and they will use a parachute to fall to safety. You then have to destroy the fallen opponents by running into them before they can blow a new balloon and rejoin the battle. Should both of your balloons get popped, you will fall into the water below and lose a life. There is also a second game variation called 'balloon trip' where you need to collect as many balloons as possible while avoiding the ocean floor and lightnings that form maze-like walls.",

He had a backup plan...and all he had to do was just wait... 6 months had passed, and somewhere from deep within Wily's abandoned lab, 4 hidden capsules activated and opened.

Bass tells Mega Man to back off, that he would stop Wily, and that Mega Man was no longer needed. Think that's gonna stop Mega Man? No way!

Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife.

He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan. While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...",

Most of the enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are the same as in the Genesis version as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Some of the boss fights differ in the Master System and Game Gear versions of the game, with special designs for the handheld version due to the smaller visible screen area.",
