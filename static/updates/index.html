    <h1 id="title">Updates to be coming</h1>
    <h2 class="updateLog " id="sectionHeader">Updated UI</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Wanted to have images on the games? Well, that will be added! Along with
      LIMITED guest mode, and creating your own accounts.</p>
    <h2 class="updateLog" id="sectionHeader">Secure chatting</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Ever wanted to talk to your friends during school but you are separated by a
      wall? Well, WebGFA can fix that! Secure chatting will ensure your chats cannot be read by the school, while still
      being fast! Who knows, maybe even video will be added!</p>
    <h2 class="updateLog" id="sectionHeader">Customized profile</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Want a profile with a bio, picture, and status? Well, we can help you! WebGFA
      will be able to get people profiles!</p>
    <h2 class="updateLog" id="sectionHeader">Hiring</h2>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Want some quick cash? Well, if you have web development skills, I could use
      some help! After all, this has been a one man job since the beginning. Come see me for details.</p>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">I am also looking for a logo redesign, because if you took the time to look you
      would relize that WebGFA's logo is just a poorly colored version of WebLFG's logo. It's also where the name WebGFA
      came from.</p>
    <p class="updateLog" id="insideText">Submitting a design, both hand drawn and digital is just as easy as <a
        href="./submitlogo">clicking me</a>. Fill out a form and you might get accepted, and if I like your logo
      the best then you will receive 10$ as a reward.</p>
