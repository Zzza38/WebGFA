  <button id="saveButton">Restore Save Data</button>
  <p>Your save data is stored in a small file on your computer. If you change computers, then the file changes and you lose the game save data. You might think, how can I restore the file if I never exported it in the first place? Well, as WebGFA runs, a script uploads that file once a minute. Here, it gets that file and lets you get your game save data back. This will overwrite any existing save data, so if you were level 3 in a game now and in the save you were level 2, the level 2 would be put in. But, if you were level 5 in a game and there is no entry for the game (you never played it before), then the save would stay since it doesn't delete data, only overwrites.</p>
